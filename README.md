# High_dimensional_cellular_automata

This repo contains two jupyter notebooks documenting my attempt to expand on the neural cellular automata work https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/. I wanted to utilize similar methods but create 3 and 4 dimensional outputs. Unfortunately the work was not up to the standard that I would like it to be for publishing. The third dimensional model was basically unable to produce meaningful output in a way that reflects the output from the original work. The fourth dimensional work was able to recreate a simiilar style of output but only in very small examples due to hardware limitations and likely the model as well. I am putting the work here as reference and in case anyone else gets similar ideas and wants to know what did and did not work.
